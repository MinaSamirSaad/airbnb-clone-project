# Airbnb Clone Project Overview

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Ensure a **simple, intuitive, and responsive interface** that works seamlessly across devices.  
- Provide **clear navigation** so users can easily move between property listings, details, and checkout.  
- Focus on **visual clarity and consistency** to reduce user confusion and improve trust.  
- Optimize for **fast interactions** with minimal clicks required to complete a booking.  

### Key Features to Implement
- **Search & Filter Options** for property listings (location, price, amenities).  
- **High-quality images and descriptions** for each property.

### Design Properties from Figma

#### Color Styles
- **Primary Color** – Used for buttons and main actions.  
- **Secondary Color** – Used for highlights and supporting UI elements.  
- **Neutral/Gray Scale** – Used for text, borders, and backgrounds.  
- **Success/Warning/Error Colors** – Used for status messages and alerts.  

#### Typography
- **Font Family:** (e.g., Inter / Roboto / Open Sans — depending on Figma file)  
- **Font Weights:** Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700)  
- **Font Sizes:**  
  - Heading 1 (e.g., 32px)  
  - Heading 2 (e.g., 24px)  
  - Body text (e.g., 16px)  
  - Small text / captions (e.g., 12–14px)  

*(Exact values should be checked in the shared Figma file and documented here.)*

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Identifying the **design properties** (colors, typography, spacing, and components) of a mockup design is crucial because:  
- It ensures **consistency** across all pages and features.  
- Developers can translate the design into code **accurately** without guessing styles.  
- It makes the design **scalable and reusable**, so new pages or components follow the same system.  
- Teams (designers, developers, and product managers) share a **common language** when discussing UI elements.  
- A well-documented design system **reduces development time** and minimizes errors.  

By aligning design properties with the mockup, the final implementation will remain **faithful to the original vision** while being easier to maintain and expand.  

## Project Roles and Responsibilities

To ensure smooth collaboration and delivery, the project team is divided into clear roles with defined responsibilities. Each role contributes uniquely to the overall success of the project.

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### 1. Project Manager
- Oversees the overall planning, execution, and delivery of the project.  
- Coordinates communication across all teams and stakeholders.  
- Manages timelines, budgets, and resource allocation.  
- Ensures risks are identified and mitigated.  

#### 2. Product Owner
- Defines the **vision and goals** of the product.  
- Maintains and prioritizes the **product backlog**.  
- Acts as the main bridge between stakeholders and the development team.  
- Ensures that delivered features align with business needs.  

#### 3. Scrum Master
- Facilitates Agile ceremonies (daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives).  
- Removes impediments that block the team’s progress.  
- Promotes Agile best practices and ensures smooth sprint execution.  
- Supports collaboration and continuous improvement within the team.  

#### 4. Frontend Developers
- Implement the **user interface (UI)** and ensure an excellent user experience (UX).  
- Work closely with designers to translate mockups into responsive web pages.

### Importance of Component Patterns
By defining and reusing UI components:
- **Consistency** is maintained across the application.  
- **Development speed** is improved by avoiding repetitive coding.  
- **Scalability** is supported since components can be easily updated or extended.  
- **User experience** benefits from predictable, familiar patterns.
