### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Identifying the **design properties** (colors, typography, spacing, and components) of a mockup design is crucial because:  
- It ensures **consistency** across all pages and features.  
- Developers can translate the design into code **accurately** without guessing styles.  
- It makes the design **scalable and reusable**, so new pages or components follow the same system.  
- Teams (designers, developers, and product managers) share a **common language** when discussing UI elements.  
- A well-documented design system **reduces development time** and minimizes errors.  

By aligning design properties with the mockup, the final implementation will remain **faithful to the original vision** while being easier to maintain and expand.
